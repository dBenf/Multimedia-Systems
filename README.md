# Multimedia Systems
This repository contains the final project of the **Multimedia Systems** course (AY 18/19) at the *University of Naples Federico II*.

## Final Project
The final project, developed in group of 3, consists in building a **Unity** application for data visualization. Specifically, the aim of the project is to visualize paths of visitors within the "**Museo Archeologico di Napoli (MANN)**".
The project has been completely developed in **C#**. The complete application developed consists in:

- A backend application intended for use by museum operators.
- A frontend application intended for use by museum's management team. With this application they can visualize paths of visitors inside the museum giving a record of paths in input. It is possible to filter the data to visualize based on different criteria. 

The 3D structure of the museum was built using **SketchUp** and then imported in Unity.
